# C++ Delegates #
The point of this repository is just to experiment and create delegates in C++.
These are not standard in C++ but are a great way for communication and it's widely known in other programming languages liek C#.
Unreal Engine is worth nothing as it has its own implementation of Delegates in C++ too.
